Here are the experiments for CASE tools with detailed steps and expected outcomes:

*Experiment 1: Develop a Mini-Project*

1. Select a mini-project domain (e.g., library management, student information system).
2. Follow the subsequent experiments to develop the project.
3. Expected outcome: A comprehensive CASE tool-based project.

*Experiment 2: Develop a Problem Statement*

1. Identify a problem domain (e.g., healthcare, finance).
2. Research and gather information about the problem.
3. Write a clear and concise problem statement.
4. Expected outcome: A well-defined problem statement.

*Experiment 3: Identify Use Cases and Develop the Use Case Model*

1. Identify the actors and use cases for the selected domain.
2. Create a Use Case diagram using a CASE tool (e.g., Lucidchart, Visual Paradigm).
3. Write use case descriptions for each identified use case.
4. Expected outcome: A complete Use Case model with diagrams and descriptions.

*Experiment 4: Identify Conceptual Classes and Develop a Domain Model*

1. Identify the conceptual classes and their attributes for the selected domain.
2. Create a UML Class diagram using a CASE tool.
3. Define the relationships between classes (e.g., inheritance, association).
4. Expected outcome: A comprehensive domain model with a UML Class diagram.

*Experiment 5: Develop UML Sequence Diagrams*

1. Select a scenario from the Use Case model.
2. Create a UML Sequence diagram to show the interaction between objects.
3. Identify the messages and their sequence.
4. Expected outcome: A UML Sequence diagram for the selected scenario.

*Experiment 6: Draw State Charts and Activity Diagrams*

1. Select a class from the domain model.
2. Create a state chart to show the object's states and transitions.
3. Select a use case from the Use Case model.
4. Create an activity diagram to show the workflow and activities.
5. Expected outcome: State charts and activity diagrams for the selected classes and use cases.

*Experiment 7: Develop a Logical Architecture Diagram*

1. Identify the User Interface, Domain objects, and Technical services layers.
2. Create a UML package diagram to show the layers and their relationships.
3. Expected outcome: A logical architecture diagram with UML package notation.

*Experiment 8: Develop and Test the Technical Services Layer*

1. Design and implement the Technical services layer.
2. Write test cases to verify the layer's functionality.
3. Execute the test cases and debug the code.
4. Expected outcome: A tested and functional Technical services layer.

*Experiment 9: Develop and Test the Domain Objects Layer*

1. Design and implement the Domain objects layer.
2. Write test cases to verify the layer's functionality.
3. Execute the test cases and debug the code.
4. Expected outcome: A tested and functional Domain objects layer.

*Experiment 10: Develop and Test the User Interface Layer*

1. Design and implement the User Interface layer.
2. Write test cases to verify the layer's functionality.
3. Execute the test cases and debug the code.
4. Expected outcome: A tested and functional User Interface layer.
